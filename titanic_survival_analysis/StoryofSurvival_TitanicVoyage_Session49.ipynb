There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, also died in the disaster."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ml1xIms4vGu2"},"source":["## The Problem\n","\n","> Over the next few sessions we will try to
